## ⚠️ Important Notes for Thesis Writer

### Key Points to Emphasize:

1. **Problem:** Remote areas have NO mobile signal for emergency calls
2. **Solution:** Internet-based reporting (WiFi OR mobile data)
3. **Scope:** Software platform only - infrastructure setup is outside scope
4. **Design:** MDRRMO calls teams directly (no individual responder accounts)
5. **Features:** Real-time alerts, automatic notifications, complete tracking

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

1. ❌ Don't say "WiFi-only system" - It works with ANY internet
2. ❌ Don't say "responder accounts" - No individual responder accounts
3. ❌ Don't say "infrastructure setup included" - It's outside scope
4. ❌ Don't say "solves all connectivity problems" - Requires internet access

### Key Messages:

1. ✅ System works with ANY internet (WiFi OR mobile data)
2. ✅ Solves connectivity gap in remote areas
3. ✅ Provides coordination and tracking
4. ✅ Infrastructure setup is barangay responsibility (outside scope)
